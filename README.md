### Access to colab notebooks and datasets:

You can run this week's satellite imaging notebooks on "Google Colab"

Sharing link for Jupyter notebooks:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xmfpG3KtoZoZwnr7pK4EEvFJfEyeAFoM?usp=sharing

Sharing link for datasets:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10HpS26ZPhUXaJ8FrEMuUD01-aSjoTfC7?usp=sharing

Steps for replicating "PrjA1_DSTL_ImgChannelsMasks.ipynb" :

- Copy shared datasets in a google drive folder
- Go to Google Colab, copy the Jupyter notebook there (or copy it in your Google Drive, click on it and select "open in Colab")
- Run the notebook (!!! you may need to edit the path to data)
