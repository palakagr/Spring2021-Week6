# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week6: Model Complexity, ROC Analysis, SVM, Semantic Segmentation, Satellite Imaging

This repository contains:

- [Model complexity, a regression example](ModelComplexity.ipynb)
- [ROC Analysis](ROC_Analysis_Example.ipynb)
- An intuitive overview of supervised learning
- [Semantic segmentation on Satellite Data, a first application](PrjD1_SemanticSeg.ipynb)
- [Introduction to satellite image analysis with Python, DSTL challenge](PrjA1_DSTL_ImgChannelsMasks.ipynb)
- [A first machine learning application using Satellite imaging, DSTL challenge](PrjB3_DSTL_Clustering.ipynb)
- [Image clustering, Philadelphia](PrjB4_Sentinel_Clustering.ipynb)


### Access to colab notebooks and datasets:

You can run this week's satellite imaging notebooks on "Google Colab"

Sharing link for Jupyter notebooks:

Sharing link for datasets:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10HpS26ZPhUXaJ8FrEMuUD01-aSjoTfC7?usp=sharing

Steps for replicating "PrjA1_DSTL_ImgChannelsMasks.ipynb" :

- Copy shared datasets in a google drive folder
- Go to Google Colab, copy the Jupyter notebook there (or copy it in your Google Drive, click on it and select "open in Colab")
- Run the notebook (!!! you may need to edit the path to data)
